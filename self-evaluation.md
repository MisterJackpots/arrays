# Arrays Self-Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?

I am feeling **very** confident with the content provided on Arrays.

1. Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?

I am always looking to absorb more knowledge on any topic we discuss, since it's all so new to me.  That said, I feel ready for the next lesson but will dig in more with Arrays if time permits.

1. What questions do you have about Arrays?

With the lesson provided, I do not have any questions about Arrays *right now*.  I am certain once I have more knowledge about Arrays and methods, I will have enough background to ask informed questions about them.
